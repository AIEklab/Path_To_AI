# Path_To_AI
Welcome! ðŸ‘‹ This repository is a collection of my mini projects as I transition from a full-time career in law enforcement to a future in artificial intelligence.

Iâ€™m currently pursuing my degree in Computer Science while serving in law enforcement, with a major career pivot planned within the next two years. Each project here reflects my ongoing journey to build programming skills, strengthen problem-solving abilities, and prepare for impactful work in AI.
